[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is among the first things that I install when setting up a new mac. 
It is a keyboard launcher similar to [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204014) supercharged.
There used to be an app called [Flashlight](https://flashlight.nateparrott.com/) that brought amazing functionality to the Spotlight. Flashlight plugins were all Python based.  
I often find looking for the same commands to run in the terminal. Over the years I have accumulated enough of these commands into a text file.
