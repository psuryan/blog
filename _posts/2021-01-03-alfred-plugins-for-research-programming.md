[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is among the first things that I install when setting up a new Mac. 
It is a keyboard launcher similar to [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204014) but supercharged.
A few years back, there used to be an app called [Flashlight](https://flashlight.nateparrott.com/) that brought amazing functionality to Spotlight. 
Sadly, Flashlight is no longer an option because it needs macOS "System Integrity Protection" to be disabled which is not safe. 

Alfred has a [lots of plugins](http://www.packal.org). In the below MindMap I have organized the top plugins that I use for programming and research. You can click on each node to learn more.
