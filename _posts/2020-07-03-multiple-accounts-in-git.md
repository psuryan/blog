Often times people have two GitHub accounts - one for work and personal. Good post on how to manage these accounts [here](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-work-with-github-and-multiple-accounts--net-22574).
As mentioned in one of the comments in the same post, it is also important to [configure the ssh-agent] (https://superuser.com/questions/272465/using-multiple-ssh-public-keys) to make this work.
