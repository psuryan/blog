With smaller laptops, vertical space comes at a premium. This is an inconvenience when reading long-form articles from news websites because of having to scroll constantly.  
Especially when using a MacBook, the dock occupies about 10% of the screen height. One could hide the dock or move it to the side, but that is only part of the solution.
For those using Firefox as their primary browser, it will be nice to be able to move the tabs to the side. This can be [accomplished](https://medium.com/@Aenon/firefox-hide-native-tabs-and-titlebar-f0b00bdbb88b) 
using the [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/) extension.
